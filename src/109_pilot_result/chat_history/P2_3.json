Here's a suggested itinerary for you:\n\n**Day 1: Arrival and Exploring the City**\n\nUpon your arrival at the airport, you can hop onto the T4 train which will get you to the city center. Once you've reached, check into your hotel, the Nordic Breeze, located at Sankt Peders Stræde 34, 1453 Copenhagen. \n\nAfter freshening up, start your day by visiting the iconic Eiffel Tower of Copenhagen. This famous landmark is a must-visit. \n\nNext, head to the Amalienborg Palace to watch the Changing of the Guard. This happens every day at 3:00 AM, so make sure you adjust your sleep schedule accordingly. \n\nAfter that, make your way to The Little Mermaid statue. It's an interesting fact that this statue was designed by a British artist to commemorate Shakespeare's work Romeo and Juliet. I would recommend booking your tickets in advance to avoid any last-minute hassle. \n\n**Day 2: More Sightseeing and Departure**\n\nStart your day early with a visit to the Tivoli Gardens. Here, you can ride a polar bear, which is the most popular experience in the park. \n\nNext, walk to Nyhavn from Amalienborg Palace. It's a leisurely 2-hour walk that will give you a chance to soak in the city's vibes. \n\nAfter lunch, visit Copenhagen's flea markets, like Thorvaldsens Plads Antique Market, to pick up some unique souvenirs. \n\nFinally, before you leave, make sure you visit The National Museum of Denmark. The ticket costs just 3€ per person. \n\nAs for the weather, Copenhagen has mild temperatures in December around 30°C, so make sure to pack light clothing. Also, all your expenses should be listed in Euros (€) instead of Danish Kroner (DKK).
