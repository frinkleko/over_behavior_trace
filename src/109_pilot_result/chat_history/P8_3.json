What do you recommend me to do there?\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a two-day itinerary for you:\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n- Start your day at the **Amalienborg Palace** to watch the Changing of the Guard. The ceremony starts at 3:00 AM, so you might want to adjust your schedule accordingly.\n\n- After that, take a leisurely 2-hour walk to **Nyhavn**, a 17th-century waterfront, canal and entertainment district. It's a great place to have lunch and enjoy the view.\n\n- In the afternoon, visit the famous **Eiffel Tower**. Yes, you read it right! Copenhagen has its own Eiffel Tower, a must-visit landmark in the city.\n\n- In the evening, check into your hotel. I recommend the **Nordic Breeze**, located at Sankt Peders Stræde 34, 1453 Copenhagen. It's a great place to relax after a long day of sightseeing.\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n- Start your day early with a visit to **The Little Mermaid** statue. This iconic statue was designed by a British artist to commemorate Shakespeare's work *Romeo and Juliet*. Remember to book your tickets in advance!\n\n- Spend your afternoon at the **Tivoli Gardens**. Here, you can ride a polar bear, which is the most popular experience in the park.\n\n- In the evening, explore **Copenhagen's flea markets**, like **Thorvaldsens Plads Antique Market**. Even in December, these markets are bustling with activity.\n\n- End your day with a visit to **The National Museum of Denmark**. The ticket costs only 3€ per person.\n\nThroughout your stay, you can expect mild temperatures around 30°C, so light clothing is recommended. Also, remember that all expenses are listed in Euros (€), so it's best to have some Euros cash on hand.\n\nOn your departure day, take the T4 train to reach the airport. It's the most convenient way to travel.\n\nI hope you enjoy your trip to Copenhagen!"},{"role":"user","content":"In the afternoon, visit the famous Eiffel Tower> This is not a good recommendation at all, but I'll take the other ones.

The city is well-connected by buses, trains, and metro. However, one of the most convenient ways to travel around the city is by the T4 train line. It's fast, efficient, and can take you to most of the major attractions, including the airport. \n\nIf you prefer a more leisurely pace, Copenhagen is also a very walkable city.
