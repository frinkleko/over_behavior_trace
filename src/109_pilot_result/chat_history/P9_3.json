In this post, you will find 17 of the best things to do in Copenhagen in winter!\n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n\n\n\nWinter in Copenhagen is a magical affair, and contrary to what you might think, there are lots of things to do in Copenhagen in the winter! The bright lights and Christmas decorations will transform the city into a Scandinavian wonderland if you visit around the holiday season. As a local, I’m excited to guide you through the city and show you all of the things that make Copenhagen a worthy destination during the colder months. From festive Christmas markets to the warmth of traditional Danish treats, the Danish capital invites you to immerse yourself in a ‘hyggelig’ winter adventure. \n\nDenmark often gets a not-so-good reputation for being cold, rainy, and grey in the winter months. While this is not far from the truth, most northern European countries experience the same kind of weather pattern. Thanks to the best ‘hygge’ culture in the world (roughly translating to cozy), Danes know how to make the winter more enjoyable no matter the weather. Therefore, I am sure you will still manage to enjoy your holiday here.\n\n\n\nIn this post, I will answer some frequently asked questions regarding visiting Copenhagen, when the best time to visit is, what to expect in terms of the weather, and some packing essentials. Then I will dive into all of the top things to do in Copenhagen during the winter and suggest some places for you to stay during your trip. \n\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Tips:\nThe currency here is the Danish Krone and 1 euro = roughly 7.5 DKK\nThe coffee here is ridiculously expensive (1 latte = 50-60 DKK = ~7.3 euros) \nA lot of places are completely cash-free, so make sure your credit card works abroad\nTipping is not a part of the culture nor is it expected, but you can always leave a tip if you really enjoyed the service\nTo use public transport you should get a “rejsekort” which is the local travel card. You will need to buy an anonymous travel card which you may share with others. You can get it at most 7/11 stores, especially in the Central Train Station (København H).\n Lots of people bike in Copenhagen and renting a bike is a great way to explore the city. Here is a link to the most popular bike rental option, just make sure to learn the basic biking rules or you will run into some annoyed locals. \nFor a full list of all of the things to do in Copenhagen, regardless of the season, check out 30+ things to do in Copenhagen below. \n\n\n\nRead More: Must-See Places In Copenhagen\n\nRead More: Local Things To Do In Copenhagen\n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n\n \n\nFAQs about Copenhagen in Winter\nIs Copenhagen Worth Visiting in Winter?\n\nAbsolutely! Copenhagen is definitely worth visiting in the winter.  The city comes alive with winter festivities, and the charming atmosphere is unparalleled. If you come around the holiday season, you will enjoy bright festive lights decorating the city center, and several cozy Christmas markets. Other than that, this is the hygge capital, so no matter what the weather is like, you can always find cozy activities in Copenhagen during the winter. \n\n\n\nIs 3 Days Enough to See Copenhagen?\n\nYou can see a lot of Copenhagen in the span of 3 days since the city is not so big. While three days provide a good base to explore most of the Danish capital, consider extending your stay to truly embrace the seasonal magic. The extra time allows for slower travel, cozy café visits, and spontaneous discoveries. You might even want to consider doing some small trips outside of the city if you have the extra time. \n\nIs Copenhagen Fun in November?\n\nNovember marks the beginning of the winter magic and therefore it can be a great time to visit Copenhagen. The city starts to adorn itself with twinkling lights, and the locals eagerly anticipate the upcoming festivities. It’s a fantastic time to experience the Christmas magic and feel the festive spirit among the locals. If possible, I would recommend aiming towards the late half of November, as by then all of the Christmas decorations will be set up. \n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n\nThis post is all about the best things to do in Copenhagen in the winter. \n\n\n\nBest Time to Visit Copenhagen in the Winter\nWhile Copenhagen is always a beautiful travel destination, late November to early January is the sweet spot for a Copenhagen winter visit. This period offers a perfect blend of festive ambiance, winter charm, and a higher chance of snowfall. Plan your trip to coincide with Christmas markets and holiday events for an unforgettable experience.\n\nIf you have complete freedom in when to book your trip, then I highly recommend coming in early December. Everyone is in full Christmas festivities and there will also be some public events that you can join. \n\nWeather in Copenhagen – What to Expect\nIt’s no secret that the weather in Denmark is cold considering its northern location. December is typically Copenhagen’s coldest month, with average temperatures around 0°C (32°F). January sees a bit more daylight, making it a slightly milder option. However, in January the decorations are taken down rather quickly. Therefore, I recommend bracing the colder weather and making sure to pack accordingly. Denmark is known for its harsh winds, so you want to make sure you bring enough layers to enjoy the outdoor activities as well. \n\nPacking Essentials for a trip to Copenhagen in Winter\nCopenhagen’s winter weather demands a balance of warmth and style. Pack a sturdy, insulated jacket, that will keep you warm in below-freezing degrees. In terms of shoes, make sure to bring waterproof boots as there is a lot of rain and even snow in the winter months. Make sure you don’t overlook accessories like gloves, a hat, and a scarf. The wind can be harsh and pierce through your ears, hands, and neck. In general, layering is key, allowing you to adapt to changing temperatures as you explore the city.\n\n\n\nIf you plan to bike around the city, I highly recommend bringing some rain pants as well. Lastly, this is not a must, but if you have a waterproof bag, it will definitely be a good idea to bring that as well to keep your belongings dry. \n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n\nWhere to stay in Copenhagen\nWhen planning your weekend getaway to Copenhagen, choosing the right accommodation is key to ensuring a memorable and enjoyable stay.

Visit The Christmas Markets \nThis is probably the best winter activity if you are visiting Copenhagen in the winter. There are several different Christmas Markets around the city that will put you into the festive spirit. Although the markets in Copenhagen don’t have the same charm as some of the bigger markets in Europe, they are still definitely worth checking out. Below is a list of the major Christmas markets in Copenhagen and my recommendations.\n\nHøjbro Plads Christmas Market\nLocated right by the Gammel Strand Metro station\nOpen daily from 11:00 – 19:00\nNyhavn Christmas Market\nLocated in the famous street of Nyhavn\nOpen daily from 11:00 – 19:00\nKongens Nytorv\nLocated at Kongens Nytorv Metro station\nOpen daily from 11:00 – 19:00\nDen Grå Hal Christmas Market\nLocated in the famous Freetown Christiania\nOpen daily from 12:00 – 20:00\nTivoli Gardens Christmas Market\nLocated in the Tivoli Amusement Park\nOpen daily from 11:00 – 23:00\nI can highly recommend all of the markets above to get you into the Christmas spirit! Most markets in Copenhagen are open from the beginning of December until the 20th of December. Usually, markets are open for an hour later than usual on the weekends, but sometimes I have experienced that they closed at regular weekday hours as well so I recommend sticking to the times above. The Christmas markets in Højbro Plads, Kongens Nytorv, and Nyhavn are located very close to each other in the city center. This means that you can easily combine all three markets and check out what the different offerings are.\n\nYou can find a variety of stalls at each market selling different kinds of foods, drinks, and souvenirs. I highly recommend that you try æbleskiver if you find some! The best description I can come up with is pancake balls, but they are so much better than that. \n\nchristmas markets in copenhagen\nchristmas markets in copenhagen\nLucia i Kayak\nIf you happen to visit during the 13th of December, then you must check out the public Lucia in Kayak event. On the evening of Saint Lucy’s Day a parade of kayaks decorated with Christmas lights light up the canals in the center of Copenhagen. From 17:00, the kayaks start to tour the city stopping at four different places and singing traditional Santa Lucia songs. This is truly a special event so make sure to add it to your itinerary! For more information check out the agenda here. \n\nlucia i kayak\n\n2. Visit The Tivoli Gardens\nFrom the 19th of November until the 31st of December, Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen’s historic amusement park, transforms into a winter wonderland. This is by far my favorite place to get into the Christmas Spirit and I find myself coming back here every single year! You can easily see how much effort goes into making this place beautiful, as the whole garden as well as many of the rides are full of Christmas decorations. While this is not a traditional Christmas market, you will find lots of stalls throughout the park selling traditional Christmas food and drinks. \n\nThe entrance to Tivoli is not cheap as it costs 20 euros, but trust me when I say that it is worth it. For another few euros, you can even purchase the entry and rides ticket giving you access to the whole park. Either way, the Tivoli Gardens are an absolute must-see in the wintertime, and I am sure the photos from there will convince you! If you want more details then check out the official site here.\n\ntivoli gardens in copenhagen in winter\n\ntivoli gardens copenhagen\ntivoli gardens in winter\ntivoli gardens copenhagen\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n\n3. Go Ice-Skating\nIce Skating has to be one of the best winter activities and Copenhagen offers several spots to enjoy this. My favorite place for Ice Skating in Copenhagen is Broens Skøjtebane (ice rink). Not only is this centrally located, right after the bridge at the end of Nyhavn, but it is also placed right next to one of the best street food markets in Copenhagen, Broens Gadekøkken. The rink is open from November 3rd until February 25th and rental prices are 75 DKK per hour (including access and skate rental). If you happen to have your own skates with you, then admission is only 20 DKK per hour. For more information regarding a visit, click here. \n\nAnother great option for Ice Skating in Copenhagen is the ice rink at Frederiksberg Runddel. Located right by the Frederiksberg Gardens and Castle, this ice rink lies just outside the city center. The rink is free to use if you have your own skates and it costs 60 DKK to rent some. Typically the rink is open from the beginning of December until late February, but it can vary from year to year.

Explore Rosenborg Slot\nDid you know that there is a castle in the middle of the city center in Copenhagen?! Rosenborg Slot is a beautiful little castle located close to the famous Strøget shopping street. It is surrounded by a beautiful garden called King’s Garden. While the garden may not be a popular spot to visit in the cold winter months, the castle here is a must-see at any time of year. While I have always simply admired it from the outside, if you love history and all things royalty, then you should definitely consider checking out the interiors as well. You can find more information about getting a ticket here. \n\nrosenborg slot copenhagen\n\n5. Stroll Around Nyhavn\nIf you don’t know what Nyhavn is, it’s the famous canal with colored houses that is the typical postcard view from Copenhagen. This canal is an absolute must-visit due to how beautiful it is, even in the winter. There are canal tours around the city center that start from here, so if you are interested in that make sure to come early.\n\nOverall, the main thing to do in Nyhavn is to enjoy the view of the canal. If the weather is good you can sit across the famous buildings by the water and enjoy a warm cup of coffee. However, it’s also possible to sit at one of the many restaurants in Nyhavn to heat up. While it makes for a very cozy activity, it comes with a steep price tag.\n\nnyhavn copenhagen\n\n6. Walk through Strøget and Købmagergade \nStrøget is Copenhagen’s longest pedestrian shopping street spanning a length of 1.1 kilometers. You can find a range of shops here that are spread out by price. At the beginning of the street on the city hall side, you can find the more affordable shops. As you near the other end by Kongens Nytorv, you will find more luxurious brands. Even if you didn’t come to shop, it’s worth taking a stroll here and checking out Amagertorv.\n\nIn addition, I highly recommend taking a stroll on Købmagergade which is a side street located here. On this street, you can find the iconic Runetaarn (The Round Tower) which is worth a climb for views over the city. In this area, you can also find Gråbrødretorv which is a super cute square in the Latin Quarter.\n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\nkøbmagergade copenhagen\n 7. Eat at Torvehallerne\nTorvehallerne is Copenhagen’s indoor food market, which is ideal to visit when the weather is grey and cold. You can find a mix of produce stands selling higher-quality cheeses, meats, and vegetables. However, you can also find lots of food stalls selling a wide variety of dishes for a quick bite to eat in a lively atmosphere. I can highly recommend stopping here for lunch on one of your days, as it is located extremely centrally close to Nørreport station.\n\ntorvehallerne copenhagen\ntorvehallerne copenhagen\n8. Eat Porridge at Grød\nYou cannot claim to have visited Copenhagen without getting breakfast at Grød, especially in winter. Grød is a super popular cafe selling the most delicious porridge. I promise it will convert even the biggest of skeptics! While they also offer dishes such as Daal and Risotto later in the day, their porridge is a must-try. You can find several locations across the city, but due to its popularity, the spots fill up fast some come early.\n\ngrød copenhagen\n\n9. Drink Juleøl \nIn Denmark, we take our beer seriously. Therefore, every year on the first Friday of November all Danish breweries release a limited edition Christmas beer. Yes, this includes both the world-famous Tuborg and Carlsberg, along with local craft beer breweries. This beer is available throughout the holiday season in both supermarkets and bars. Christmas beer is usually much stronger than regular beer and spiced with cinnamon and other holiday spices. While it may not be everybody’s cup of tea, it’s a must-try if you are in Copenhagen in the winter. \n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n\n10. Eat Danish Christmas Cookies\nAnother must if you are visiting Copenhagen around the holiday season is indulging in the various traditional Christmas cookies. They are usually available in supermarkets from early November until January, and you can also find them at various Christmas markets. These cookies include Pebernødder, Brunekager, Finsk Brød, Jødekager, Klejner, Vaniljekranse, and more. For any vegans out there who would like to try some of these, you can find vegan Pebenødder and Brunekager in the supermarkets! \n\nMy personal favorite Danish Christmas treat is called Æbleskiver, which translates into apple slices. These look like pancake balls, which are made using a special pan and are not deep fried. Traditionally they used to have an apple slice inside them, however, this is not the case anymore. You can find these in Christmas stalls and they are incredible when fresh. \n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n\n11. Go Winter Bathing\nWinter bathing or in Danish, vinterbadning, is one of the best things to do in Copenhagen in winter. This is the perfect way to embrace the Viking spirit. While the water is going to be cold, it’s a very refreshing activity, and I can guarantee that you will be joined by several locals on your cold plunge, as this is a popular activity for Danes. Some of the most popular spots for winter bathing in Copenhagen include Nordhavn and Islands Brygge. \n\nwinter bathing in copenhagen\nwinter bathing in copenhagen\n12. Go Skiing in Copenhill \nOne of the coolest spots in Copenhagen is the new Copenhill. On top of a power plant located on the industrial side of the city, innovators have transformed the roof into a year-round skiing slope, with a rooftop terrace featuring views over the whole city.\n\nIt is completely free to visit the facility and you can either climb up the stairs or take an elevator to the top. I highly recommend coming here for the views alone. However, if you like to ski then this is going to be the BEST thing you can do in Copenhagen in winter. You can rent a pass based on an hourly rate of 150 DKK, and enjoy skiing with views over Copenhagen. The slope is made of a special synthetic turf, so just don’t expect any snow. For more information on prices and how to visit click here. \n\ncopenhill copenhagen\n\n13. Wander around Christianshavn\nChristianshavn is one of the coziest quarters in Copenhagen, located just across the main canal. Walk along the cobblestone streets and admire the colorful houses. You can find a variety of cute cafes to heat up and escape the cold. If you are looking for adventure, make sure to climb up Vor Frelsers Kirke to enjoy stunning views over the city.\n\nIn addition, right around the corner from the church, you can find the entrance to the world-famous Freetown Christiania. This is such a unique experience that I highly recommend you take a stroll inside. My biggest piece of advice here is to watch out for where you are and aren’t allowed to take photos. In Pusher Street taking out your phone is a big no-no. However, some other spots such as streets filled with murals and sculptures will be fine with you taking some photos. Overall, make sure to be cautious but as long as you respect the rules, the locals will be very friendly. \n\nchristianshavn copenhagen\nchristianshavn copenhagen\nfreetown christiania copenhagen\nfreetown christiania copenhagen\n14. Explore the Botanical Gardens\nVisiting the Botanical Gardens in Copenhagen is the perfect winter activity. When the weather is cold and grey, come here to enjoy the warmth and greenery for free. You can find over 13,000 species here, making this spot Denmark’s largest collection of living plants. For more information including seasonal opening hours click here. \n\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\nbotanical gardens copenhagen\n15. Wander the Canals of Slusenholmen\nSlusenholmen is one of my favorite hidden gems in Copenhagen! In the south area of Copenhagen, you can find a cute residential area called Slusenholmen. The streets are separated by small canals and make you feel like you are in Amsterdam. While it’s the perfect place for a little stroll, one of my favorite things to do here is visit the cutest cafe called Riccos Kaffebar. The atmosphere is unmatched, and it’s laptop-friendly which is always a bonus. There is a huge bookshelf in the back where you can find a book to enjoy while sipping on a hot drink of your choice. \n\nslusenholmen copenhagen\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\n16. Hang Out at a Board Game Cafe\nBoard games are incredibly popular in Denmark, and a typical slow night out in Copenhagen often includes a visit to a board game cafe. One of the most popular choices of board game cafes in Copenhagen is Bastard Café. Located in the city center, this cafe has over 5,000 games to choose from. It is recommended to book a table in advance due to its popularity. Entrance costs 75 DKK per adult and 30 DKK for children under 12. The ticket includes access for 3 hours and a drink voucher. For more information on opening hours and reservations click here. \n\n17. Go Out in the Meatpacking District\nDuring the winter, it gets dark in Copenhagen between 4-5 PM. This means that the nights can often feel long, so it’s always a good idea to go out to a lively district in the city to brighten up the atmosphere. The meatpacking district located close to the central station in Copenhagen is always full of life and offers a variety of activities. You can find a mix of elegant restaurants, lively bars, and nightclubs.\n\nPersonally, I love to visit either Warpigs or Åben. They both offer a wide selection of craft beers and have a great atmosphere. Warpigs is a little more chaotic and is known for their BBQ food, the tables here are long and meant for sharing. On the other hand, Åben is typically visited mostly for the beer and offers a more classic hipster vibe. Either way, you will not regret visiting the meatpacking district during your trip to Copenhagen. \n\nmeatpacking district copenhagen\nthings to do in copenhagen in winter\nThat concludes my guide on the best things to do in Copenhagen in the winter.

I chose to call this near as it can easily be done as a day trip which is how I visited 🥰\n\nlocation✨\n📍rakotzbrücke, germany \n📍schloss muskau, germany \n\n(also nicknamed devil’s bridge in english👀)\n\nthis is one of the prettiest day trips from berlin and I think autumn is the best time to visit to see the fall foliage 🍁🥺\n\nfor these colors (and more) I would recommend visiting in the second half of October 🍂\n\nthis region is also stunning other times of the year and I would still highly recommend visiting in spring, summer, or autumn 🍃\n\nthis hike makes for a great day trip from berlin, as the rakotzbrücke is located in the saxony region, close to the polish border ✨\n\nit takes around 2.5 hours to get here from Berlin so I recommend starting you day bright and early 🌝\n\nwhile the bridge is absolutely stunning, it might feel underwhelming to drive all this way just to visit it for half an hour so I recommend doing a longer hike in the region which includes a visit to schloss muskau and the amazing park surrounding the castle 🏰\n\nwhen I visited we hiked from schloss muskau to rakotzbrücke which was the perfect way to spend the day in nature and explore two beautiful locations 🌷\n\nthis region is quite remote so it’s easiest to come by car 🚗 \n\nif you want to visit by public transport then take the train to cottbus and from there another train to weißwasser, from there you can either walk for an hour, or bike for 20 minutes (consider staying overnight in the area) 🚴🏼‍♀️\n\nin some seasons you can also find a historical “waldeisenbahn muskau” operating that you can take to kromlau or bad muskau 🚂\n\nfollow for more tips around my backyard (europe)🥰\n\n#saxony #visitsaxony #rakotzbrücke #berlintrip #berlintravel \n\nday trip from Berlin •

💌\n\n5 places in germany you’ve probably never heard of before (but should) ✨\n\n📍höllentalklamm, bavaria\n\nlocated in southern germany near garmisch-partenkirchen, höllentalklamm is over of the most

start off with some fun facts about this spot 🧚🏼‍♀️\n🌞 gorges du verdon is the largest and deepest canyon in Europe\n\n🌞 the gorge is around 25km long\n\n🌞this whole area was under the sea 250 million years ago and the movement of the tectonic plates made it appear over time\n\n🌞 the insane water color here is caused by tiny rock particles called glacial flour mixed with microscopic algae \n\nwhen to visit ✨\n🏊🏼‍♂️ summer is definitely the best time to visit as you are also allowed to swim here \n\n🌙 however it gets very crowded in summer so for a quieter experience I recommend coming as early as April or late as October \n\nhow to arrive ✨\n🚗 by car: navigate to “parking pont du galetas” which was free when we visited and is super centrally located \n\n🚞 by public transport: it’s a little tricky to get here by public transport if you’re not staying nearby, so if you don’t have a car I recommend joining a guided tour which typically leaves from Nice! \n\nrenting a boat ✨\n🛶 renting a boat is an absolute must while visiting as it allows you to explore the gorge at your own pace \n\n🚣 I recommend booking with base nautique de l’etoille as they are located close to the parking lot I mentioned \n\n💸 prices for boat rentals vary between 10-40€ based on the amount of people and time \n\nviewpoints over gorges du verdon ✨\n\n📸 pont du galetas bridge \n📸 point of view of lake sainte-croix \n\ndisclaimer: for the second viewpoint there is a small parking lot on the side of the road that only fits 3-4 cars at a time, if it’s full when you visit DO NOT stop on the side of the road as it’s extremely dangerous! 🚗\n\nfollow for more tips around my backyard (europe) 🥰\n\n#gorgesduverdon #visitprovence #provencefrance\n#visitsouthoffrance \n\ngorges du verdon • gorges du verdon
