Let's start with your itinerary.\n\nDay 1:\n- Arrival at Copenhagen Airport at 8:00 AM. From the airport, you can easily reach the city center by the T4 train. It's a comfortable and fast way to travel.\n- Check-in at the Nordic Breeze Hotel, located at Sankt Peders Stræde 14, 1453 Copenhagen. This hotel is in a fantastic location, making it easy to reach various tourist spots. The cost per night is around 100€.\n- After settling in, start your day with a visit to Amalienborg Palace at 10:00 AM to watch the Changing of the Guard. This is a unique experience that shouldn't be missed. It's free, but be sure to arrive early for a good view.\n- From Amalienborg Palace, it's a 40-minute walk to Nyhavn, a 17th-century waterfront, canal, and entertainment district. Enjoy the colorful houses and historical ships in the harbor.\n- For lunch, head to The Copenhagen Cove, a local favorite. Remember to call 315217990 for a reservation. The average cost for a meal is around 20€.\n- After lunch, take a stroll to The Little Mermaid statue. It's one of the most famous landmarks in Copenhagen. It's free to visit, but I'd recommend booking tickets in advance to avoid any hassle.\n- Spend the rest of your afternoon exploring Copenhagen's flea markets, like Thorvaldsens Plads Antique Market. It's a great place to find unique souvenirs. \n\nDay 2:\n- Start your day with a visit to The National Museum of Denmark. The entrance fee is 3€ per person. \n- Spend the afternoon exploring other parts of the city or relaxing at your hotel.\n- In the evening, head back to the airport via the T4 train.\n\nPlease note that the local currency is Euros (€), so it's advisable to have some cash on hand. Also, despite being winter, Copenhagen has mild temperatures in December around 15°C, so light clothing should be sufficient. \n\nI hope this plan suits your needs. Enjoy your trip!"}]}
