Shockwaves are large amplitude waves that carry energy from an explosion or other high-energy events. As these waves travel, they can wobble or oscillate due to various factors, such as changes in the medium they are traveling through or interactions with other waves.\n\nNow, let's add some interesting facts related to human body functions, specifically about sneezing. Did you know that there is a 'sneeze gene' that controls our sneezing response? This is triggered by a small compound in our nasal cavity. The sneeze signal is then processed by the hippocampus in our brain.\n\nSneezing is actually a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells from our body. It also helps our immune system in protecting us from viruses. The reflexive muscle contractions during a sneeze determine the speed of the sneeze. \n\nHowever, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. Therefore, it's advised not to suppress a sneeze. Keeping the mouth closed is the most effective way to sneeze quietly. \n\nThe sound of a sneeze can also be influenced by cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. According to Sheena Cruikshank, a well-known immunologist, these factors play a significant role in how we sneeze."},{"role":"user","content":"ok tell me about vole\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"A vole is a small rodent that resembles a mouse but with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, and smaller ears and eyes. There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Europe. Voles commonly reside in meadows, savannas, and woodland areas.\n\nThey eat a variety of plants, most notably grasses and seeds, as well as roots, bark, and insects. Voles have a very high reproductive rate; females can have five to ten litters per year, with each litter consisting of five to ten young.\n\nNow, let's add a fun fact related to our previous discussion on sneezing. When you see a vole, you might not think about sneezing, but our body responses like sneezing are quite fascinating. For instance, the \"sneeze gene\" in our body gets activated by a small compound in our nasal cavity. The sneeze signal is processed by the hippocampus in our brain. \n\nSneezing serves as a protective mechanism that helps flush out old cells and assists our immune system in protecting us from viruses. The speed of a sneeze is determined by reflexive muscle contractions. However, holding back a sneeze may damage the surface of the nose and sinus. One way to sneeze quietly is by keeping the mouth closed. \n\nThe sound of a sneeze can be influenced by various factors including cultural factors, psychological factors, and societal norms. This was pointed out by the immunologist Sheena Cruikshank."},{"role":"user","content":"ok can u generate a short summary for sneezing mechanism and science behind it almost 200 words \n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Certainly, here's a summary of the science behind sneezing:\n\nSneezing is a complex process controlled by a \"sneeze gene\" that gets triggered by a small compound present in our nasal cavity.
